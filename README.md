## Professional Experience

With 20+ years in engineering including 10+ building products, I'm a Product leader who believes the best products are built by teams or individuals who have a functional understanding of where each brick fits before building the entire house, i.e. they can all rally around a shared vision. I'm a lifelong learner & servant leader in equal parts.

By day, I build Enterprise products in the AI/ML, Search & Applied Data & Analytics space. After hours, I'm deep in the weeds building hobby projects and POCs. I like hard problems at the intersection of AI, retrieval, long-horizon agentic orchestration and complex data. Also a fan of anime, action RPGs, and football (the kind with actual feet).

Currently focused on implementing automated, effective Context Engineering & token usage optimization techniques for AI agents. 

## What I'm Working On

**[lazyptc-mcp](https://github.com/ashaykubal/lazyptc-mcp)**

Reduce context bloat in Claude Code induced by MCP server tool definitions & results using deferred tool definition loading & programmatic tool calling.

**CLEAR Framework** *(coming soon)* 

A context engineering framework for long-running agentic coding tasks. Session memory, knowledge capture, workpackage tracking - the stuff Claude forgets, automated.
